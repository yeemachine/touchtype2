 -->
An interactive type projection that utilizes simple body tracking from [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)
and the Reynolds Flocking algorithm [example](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/124-flocking-boids.html) by the Coding Train.

VER 2 now made with Pixi.js for better performance!
===============

Use your hands or your face to distort the type. Walk away from the camera and watch the type disappear. 
Try it out [here](https://pose2.yee.gd) or remix the code [on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pose2).
